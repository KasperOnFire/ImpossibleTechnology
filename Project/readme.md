### Dependencies & how to run

The following dependencies should be installed in your system, either via `conda install` or `pip install`

```python
import pandas
import matplotlib
import numpy
```

Clone from git repository, `cd Project` and run the project from command promt with the command line:

`python run.py`

Or by opening the run file in your chosen environment and running the file.

The size column in the CSV file was renamed because otherwise pandas would not function correctly. It was renamed from 'size' to 'sizetransfer'
